## About The Project
This is a fullstack application for showing geographical information of entities on the map. First, a dummy data of 10 drivers are generated using factory boy. These data are then added to the database. A scheduled task updates the positions of each driver in a given range every 5 seconds and updates the database. Frontend fetches the data from django backend and shows the positions of each driver with different colored markers on the map. When the page is refreshed change of the positions can be observed.

### Built With
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for creating single page apps.
* [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - An open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - A web framework for python.
* [Redis](https://redis.io/) - Backend for running scheduled jobs
* [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Database.
* [Celery](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/index.html) - Distributed Task Queue.
* [FactoryBoy](https://factoryboy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - Test fixture creator/ dummy data generator.

## Getting Started
In order to run this project some libraries should be installed and configured. I will explain to install the libraries and frameworks for Linux. But Mac users can use 'brew' instead of 'sudo apt-get'.
### Install
1) We need to install the GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library), PostgreGIS, Redis and Postgres
 ```sh
 sudo apt-get install gdal-bin
 sudo apt-get install libpq5
 sudo apt-get install postgresql
 sudo apt-get install postgresql-contrib
 sudo apt install redis-server
 ```
2) We need to install the python libraries.
 ```sh
python3 -m venv virtual-env
source virtual-env/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 ```
3) We should create and activate a postgres database. It is created without password in this example. We can alsocreate the database using PgAdmin4 with GUI.
 ```sh
  sudo service postgresql initdb
  sudo service enable postgresql
  sudo service start postgresql
  sudo -u postgres psql
  CREATE DATABASE <myDatabase>
   ```
### Configuration
In projects settings.py file we configure the database locally.
```sh
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.contrib.gis.db.backends.postgis",
        "HOST": "localhost",
        "NAME": <replaceWithDbName>,
        "PORT": 5432,
        "USER": <replaceWithUsername>,
        (if Password exits)
        "PASSWORD": <replaceWithPassword>,
    }
}
```
Now we should migrate the database,
```sh
cd ~/driverTracker
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```
Then we create super user for our django app. With this user credentials we can switch to admin panel in  http://localhost:8000/admin after running the server.
```sh
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
We should also run the redis-server in another terminal in the background.
```sh
redis-server
```
Finally, we switch to frontend and install packages.

   ```sh
   cd ~/driverTracker/frontend
   npm install
   ```
### How To Run
1) Redis-server and Postgres should be up and running in the background.
2) We populate dummy data and insert into the database. In driverTracker/tests folder we have       factories.py file which generates and saves the initial drivers data for us. In driverTracker/mapApp/management/commands, seed.py file creates a django command to populate the data from terminal. (default: 10 drivers). We can run this script;
   ```sh
    python3 manage.py seed.py
   ```
3) We should be in the driverTracker folder and run the celery command to start scheduled worker and tasks in different terminals (both runs in the background)
```sh
  celery -A driverTracker worker 
  celery -A driverTracker beat -S django 
 ```

4) Then, we run our django backend inside the /driverTracker;
```sh
  python3 manage.py driverTracker runserver
 ```
 Now server should be running in http://127.0.0.1:8000/

 5) In another terminal we go to /driverTracker/frontend folder and start the front-end.
 ```sh 
  npm run start
 ```

 Front-end runs in http://127.0.0.1:3000/map-drivers
 Now, we should be able to see a map with 10 markers. The data is updated in the backend periodically. We can refresh the page and observe markers moving.
